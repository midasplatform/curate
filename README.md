# Curate Module for Midas Server #

A module to allow for curation of datasets within a folder.

A user would track a folder for curation, which changes the curation state to
construction. The user then adds content and when satisfied, requests approval
from a curation moderator, changing the curation state to requested. If the
moderator approves the request, the curation state becomes approved.
